Business Context:

This case study delves into the intricacies of financial products, focusing on the widely recognized term depositâ€”a mechanism where customers entrust a sum of money to a bank or financial institution, with withdrawals permitted only after a specific period. This arrangement empowers banks to channel funds into higher-yield financial products, enhancing overall profitability. In the dynamic landscape of financial offerings available to the public, term deposits stand out as a key player, providing stability and investment potential for both customers and financial institutions. The core of the term deposit mechanism involves customers depositing a sum of money, which remains inaccessible until a predetermined timeframe elapses. This unique setup enables banks to allocate deposited funds into higher-yield financial instruments, thereby maximizing profitability. In return, customers receive fixed interest based on their deposited amount. This reciprocal arrangement is encapsulated by the Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR), calculated as Total Loans divided by Total Deposits, as outlined in Investopedia (source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan-to-deposit-ratio.asp). A higher LDR signifies increased investment capacity for the bank, translating to potential gains. If a bank's deposits are increasing, new money and new clients are being on-boarded. As a result, the bank will likely have more money to lend, which should increase earnings. One effective strategy to attract customers to subscribe to a term deposit involved a well-panned marketing campaigns.

- Problem Statement

A bank marketing campaign serves as a bridge between financial institutions and customers, enabling banks to promote their products and services while providing customers with valuable information, choices, and convenience. When executed effectively, a bank marketing campaign benefits both the bank and its customers by building trust, enhancing financial well-being, and maintaining long-term relationships.

Focusing on the term deposit product, the bank should be able to conduct a marketing campaign targeting the right customers who are likely to make a deposit. In other words, it should minimize the possibility of targeting customers who are not willing to make a deposit while also maintaining relationships with them.

- Goals

Therefore, based on the problem statement above, the bank aims to identify customers who have a higher chance of subscribing to a term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such clients. The bank wants to have the ability to predict which customers are likely to make a deposit and conduct a marketing campaign for those who genuinely want to subscribe to a term deposit. Additionally, the bank aims to identify the most important features in subscribing to deposits. This way, in the future, the bank can focus on those features. Thus, customer divided into two targets class, as follows:

- Target

0: Customers unlikely to subscribe to a term deposit.

1: Customers likely to subscribe to a term deposit.
